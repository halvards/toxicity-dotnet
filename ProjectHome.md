Visualisation and reporting of code toxicity for .NET.

For a detailed explaination of what code toxicity means, please read this: http://erik.doernenburg.com/2008/11/how-toxic-is-your-code/

The input file format is taken from .NET Reflector (http://www.red-gate.com/products/dotnet-development/reflector/),
using the CodeMetrics add-in (http://reflectoraddins.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=CodeMetrics).

Unfortunately toxicity-dotnet hasn't had much love for a long time, so for a more modern tool that also doesn't depend on .NET Reflector, we would suggest looking at this tool instead: https://github.com/AdamNowotny/toxicity-charts
